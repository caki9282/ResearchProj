PROJECT PROPOSAL:
I wanted to do further research into different grip machinics in VR.
Calvin Kim - SOLO

INTERACTION DESCRIPTION:
- Ray Tracing is being able to point or hover your hand over an object, and then the object goes towards your hand.
- Dual Grip, Being able to grip a single object with two hands and manipulate the object with both hands.
- Mag-ic Wand, Being able to pick up this wand and, with its magnetic abilities, push around objects with the wand.

OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS
QUESTIONS:
PRE:
- What type of physical accessibility problems do you think are most prevalent in VR 
- What type of interactions have you experienced in the context of VR
- What type feels the most immersive  
POST:
- Which of the three interactions gave you the most trouble
- What felt the most smooth
- How could I improve these designs to be more accessible
RESPONSES:
Swyer
- Blindness, 
- Ray cast, direct interaction, Half-life alyx pull.
- The direct interaction

- The hammer because the dual grip function would not orient correctly once grabbing it with two hands
- The ray cast grab
- Being able to switch the wand so that it can pull objects as well as push them.

Nate
- Lack of physical space,
- Trigger grab, inner trigger grab, a button grab
- The side grip feels the most and leaves the most open. 

- The hammer was chosen mainly because the other hand would conflict with the orientation. Plus, you had to grab it with both hands once you grabbed it. 
- The cube grab and wand felt very natural and smooth
- The wand would help with accessibility with limited space.

Peter
- Blindness… motor complications 
- Vive controller, oculus controller, props
- Physics interactions that I can interact with, pick up stuff and move it between my hands.

- The Hammer 
- Cube was the easiest interaction across all the objects the ray casting wasn’t easy to get
- Don't hold buttons, sticky keys, that can't use their hands something for the look and a big button. 

Carter:
- The price of it comparative to time of use
- Full hand tracking stuff like that, a little with a racing sim doesn’t work the greatest.
- If you have a controller, grabbing objects felt the best in terms of how it would line up.

- The grabbing of the object the way it would align inside your hand.
- The overall physics when objects were colliding like the hammer and the balls
- Adjusting the level of sensitivity and range of grabbing objects and movement.

Walker:
- Weak grip strength elderly people age for younger kids.
- grabbing , some of the movements were you flick yourself around.
- Moving in zero gravity, yanking yourself around a space, so sort of grabbing.

- The two handed grip
- Grabbing from the distance but there was a weird angle to it, and the movement.
- Assign grabbing buttons to other parts of the controller so that it can be accessible to more people.

OBSERVATIONS:
My overall observations from all the testing was 1, definitely test my project before demo day cause that was a hot mess, but also there was a little more polisihing that needed to be done as there were concepts of interactions but due to them being slightly buggy it made it hard for my testers to give a fair testing and review as when something doesn't work the way you want it to it hard for them to judge it and make the correct improvements. Also testing my stuff with the right audicance. because im testing about accessibility I should test it with the correct demographic.
